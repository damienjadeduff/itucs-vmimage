Connecting to eduroam
---------------------

You can use the "eduroam" wi-fi network for connecting your computers
to the Internet. For the networks settings under Linux Mint XFCE,
you need to be aware of the following:

- Under wi-fi security, choose "Protected EAP (PEAP)"
  as the authentication option.

- As your username, enter your ITU e-mail address (not just your username).

- Make sure that the box "No CA certificate is required" is checked.
